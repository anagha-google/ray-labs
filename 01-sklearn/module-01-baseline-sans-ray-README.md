# Module 01: Baseline - Training and serving a basic sklearn model on Vertex AI (no Ray)

## 1. About the module

The notebook for this module is a baseline training experiment with Scikit-Learn- and without Ray. The subsequent modules that cover Ray, will not include the level of detail in the area of Exploratory Data Analysis as in this module. This module also serves as a primer to BigQuery, Vertex AI and batch inferencing with BigQuery ML (BQML) if you are unfamiliar with the same.


### 1.1. Content covered

This notebook for this module includes an end to end sample for -

1. Training a Scikit-Learn Random Forest Classifier model
2. Registering the model in Vertex AI model registry
3. Operationalizing the model for online predictions with Vertex AI endpoints
4. Online inferencing from Python with Vertex AI online serving
5. Batch infernencing in BQML
   
It includes the following steps:
1. Curating the training data source in BigQuery
2. Profiling the data
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Feature engineering
5. Model training
6. Model registration into Vertex AI Model Registry
7. Deployment of model to Vertex AI Endpoint
8. Online inferencing
9. Registering a model trained elsewhere in BQML
10. Batch inferencing with BQML
